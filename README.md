# DTU 2024 Deep Learning: Using GAN's Discriminator to Classify Real and Fake Images

Sampling using `BigGAN-PyTorch`:

1. Download the weights: [BigGAN_ch96_bs256x8_138k.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAle7FCVFZdix2--ks0r5JBkFnKw8ctW/view)
2. Unpack them under `BigGAN-PyTorch/weights/`
3. Copy file `src/discriminate.py` to `BigGAN-PyTorch/`, and run it. Make sure you've got some generated/real images in `generated-imageges`.
